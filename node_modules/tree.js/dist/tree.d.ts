/** This is an implementation of fully linked nary-trees. Each non-leaf node has an array
of its children `children`, a reference to its left sibling `ls`, a reference to its right
sibling `rs` and a reference to its parent `parent`.
The Tree object is a collection of methods to handle tree structures, its not instanciated
itself. Instead, each object can be a tree node.

Most of the methods can accept both a single node or an array of nodes to work on.
